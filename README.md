# Dales input case generator
This repository contains a script (main.py) that generates complete DALES cases (except for the dales binary).
Each case is configurable with a yaml config file found in the [cases](./cases) folder.

## Usage
Either edit the variable ```BASE_OUTPUT_PATH``` in the [main.py](main.py) script, or edit the path setting in each yaml script. (note that a tilde ~ indicating the home directory does not work in BASE_OUTPUT_PATH.)
This path will be the base path for the cases that are generated by this script.
The required packages can be found in requirements.txt.

Running the script by default creates all the cases found in the [cases](./cases) folder.
In each case will be a job.001 file which is the job that runs DALES. To make this script work, you need to specify the dales executable in the job.001 file. (it is advisable to edit this in the template job.001 in the top folder of this repository.)
